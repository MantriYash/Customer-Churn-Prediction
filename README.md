# Customer-Churn-Prediction
## Overview
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when a customer stops using a company's product or service. In today's highly competitive business environment, predicting and preventing customer churn is essential for maximizing revenue and maintaining a loyal customer base.

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn based on demographic, account, and service-related data. By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can proactively implement retention strategies.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to build a classification model that predicts customer churn using:
- **Demographic data** (e.g., gender, senior citizen status, tenure)
- **Service usage details** (e.g., internet service, phone service, online security)
By leveraging machine learning, we aim to help businesses:
- Identify customers likely to churn.
- Design targeted retention strategies.
- Minimize revenue loss.

## üìÅ Dataset Information
**Dataset Name:** `Customer_data`:**https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rnBO9F9xdSUY-WpeOJilMxMRZT-hwwWq6O98OHreY0k/edit?gid=1602415961#gid=1602415961**

- The dataset contains customer-related features such as demographic details, service subscriptions, and account tenure.
- The target variable is **Churn**, which indicates whether a customer has left the service or not.

#Deliverables
1Ô∏è**Data Preprocessing** - Analyze the dataset, handle missing values, perform feature engineering, and prepare data for modeling.
2Ô∏è**Machine Learning Model** - Train classification models, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
